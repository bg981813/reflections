What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You create a new repository with nothing in it in the location that youre currently working in. The repository is what allows version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It is the middle man between the two. It offers value by giving the user more control upon what they commit from the directory.
