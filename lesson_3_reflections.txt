When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you want to work from different locations or on different computers. Also, if you're working with a team or other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because, by pulling some of the commits, it might affect what you are currently working on.
