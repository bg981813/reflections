When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you want to work from different locations or on different computers. Also, if you're working with a team or other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because, by pulling some of the commits, it might affect what you are currently working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks basically clone another repository, while giving credit to the creator.
	Clones just clone a repository to a local repository.
	Branches can have seperate commits, until the features are working and ready to merge to the master.
